<h1>Academic Performance Prediction: Impact of Sleep and Study Time</h1>
This project aims to predict and analyze the impact of two factors—sleep duration and study time—on an individual's academic performance.</br> 
The model uses linear regression to evaluate how much sleep and study time contribute to improving academic grades or test scores.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Linear Regression: Uses linear regression to predict academic performance based on the amount of sleep and study time.</li>
  <li>Data Visualization: Plots relationships between sleep, study time, and academic performance to better understand the trends.</li>
  <li>Analysis: Analyzes the importance of each factor (sleep and study time) in determining academic performance.</li>
</ul>
